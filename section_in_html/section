<h2>Section 1</h2>
<p>Modern civilization is based upon the use of machines. For doing their workday in and day out the machines need a constant supply of energy without which they would come to a halt. Our transport systems-diesel-run railways, steamships, motor vehicles, aeroplanes-all constantly need natural fuel to keep on moving. In the last three hundred years, much of human efforts have been spent in search of the sources of energy-coal, petroleum, and power generated from water–which will maintain the present rhythm of civilization unchecked. Not only that; as the population of the world increases, the need for energy will also increase. But there is the real fear that the world reserves for energy sources of petroleum, coal, and hydel-power are gradually being exhausted. That is why new and unconventional sources of energy like nuclear and solar energy need to be developed. While the advanced countries in America and Europe have the wealth and scientific know-how to produce solar and nuclear energy on a commercial scale, the poorer Asiatic countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh may develop an energy source by bio-gas-developing machines. But the point is that researches in the field of development of new energy sources must be carried on further and expedited so that the exhaustion of the conventional sources of power does not adversely affect the growth of our economy and progress of civilization.
